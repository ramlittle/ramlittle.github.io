 The chickens have layed their eggs in the dog's territory. Since the dogs are very territorial, whoever tresspasses will face the consequences. You will play as one of the dogs to destroy the chicken's nests of eggs.

Dog's have rockets with ammo. Chicken's have hidden their eggs on the field. The Dog's have no idea where exactly the eggs are hidden so you will have to launch attacks based on the field's coordinates and hopefully it lands a hit.

The chicken's plan to retrieve their eggs to save their kind. Wreck the eggs before they do so that they will never come back!

The eggs are hidden somewhere in the field. You must guess which has eggs on them. When your attacks lands a hit, it will deduct the number of eggs. The field coordinates hit will become a crater when your attack lands a hit or a miss.

The game ends if your Ammo is zero or you have wrecked all eggs on the field or if time limit has been reached.
